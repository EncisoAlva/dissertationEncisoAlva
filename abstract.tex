A central task for Neuroscience is to determine the location of electrical activity of neural origin inside the brain. 
%
Electrical signals can be recorded at a high resolution in time but low resolution in space, thus making it difficult to locate their source unambiguously. 
%
Electrical Source Imaging (ESI) is a particular framework for neural electrical source location; it is possible by modeling any additional information we may have about the electrical sources.
%
For instance, minimal-norm estimators assume that the most plausible estimation is that with a lower norm.
%
However, these estimators possess a low resolution in space. 

In this work, we construct a novel ESI estimator incorporating binary anatomical data from pathologies observed in the post-mortem.
%
This is done to improve the spatial resolution of the estimator.

This work may be extended to similar types of binary data derived from fMRI, NIRS, and CT, among others.
